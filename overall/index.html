	<p>It’s clear from <a href="/intro/">the main guide</a> that <a href="/hackers/">hackers target everyone who can make them money</a>. It’s also clear that <a href="/how_hacked/">we don’t have a good overall view</a> of all the ways they target us.</p>

<p>That being said, you are not powerless.</p>

<p>We might not know have a complete <em>list</em> of threats, but we know a lot about the big ones. Despite the holes in our data, <strong>it is still possible to find good (if incomplete) security advice</strong>⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#landwehr_cybersecurity_2012">(Landwehr, 2012, p. 4)</a></span>⁠<!-- "One simply must realize that while the search for the right foundations proceeds, construction will continue." SOK summarizes it without further comment: "lacking such foundations need not preclude advancing the state-of-the-practice" -->.</p>

<p>Here’s some advice—advice to take and advice to avoid—that I’ve found while researching this guide.</p>

<h2 id="rules-for-good-advice">Rules for good advice</h2>

<p>There’s lots of security advice out there, so before piling on more, I want to offer some tips for reading it.</p>

<p>The easiest thing to do? Look for <strong>scientific</strong> advice—advice with clear context, measurements, and expected impact. Most security advice offers none of that⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#herley_more_2014">(Herley, 2014, sec. 2.2; Wash, 2010, p. 12; Herley, 2009; Florêncio &amp; Herley, 2010)</a></span>⁠, even if it’s written with the same authoritative “scientific tone.”</p>

<p>I’ve found a few easy indicators of good, scientific advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Good advice will focus on outcomes</strong>. What does this advice protect you against? How much protection does it give you?<!-- For example, accounts with 2-factor authentication are 99.9% less likely to be hacked. [multiple](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984) [Microsoft](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/all-your-creds-are-belong-to-us/ba-p/855124) [reports](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/10/03/password-doesnt-matter-mfa-does/) note that accounts with 2-factor authentication are more than 99.9% less likely to be compromised than accounts with only a password. --></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Good advice will state its assumptions</strong>. Does this advice protect the things <em>you</em> care about? Does it expect your attackers can’t harass you in person?<!-- For example, a dissident journalist, a domestic violence survivor, and (hopefully) you each have very different worries. --><!--Different people have different threats. Are you being targeted by a government with millions of dollars to spend taking you down (see [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet))? You'll make very different assumptions about what your attackers can do than someone targeted by a 15 year old in their parents' basement. Plus, a great password might not matter [if your attackers have a wrench](https://xkcd.com/538/).--></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Good advice won’t claim to be complete</strong> (or it won’t claim that it’s all necessary). Would you wear a bullet-proof vest to work? It might make your defense against bullets more <em>complete</em>, but I doubt you find that <em>necessary</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The advice here tries to do all these things. It tries to focus on outcomes and state its assumptions, and it’s certainly not complete. But hopefully, you find it helps anyway.</p>

<h2 id="advice-to-take">Advice to take</h2>

<aside class="alert info">
  <p>(These write-ups are in progress.)<!-- TODO --></p>
</aside>

<ol>
  <li>Turn on <a href="/passwords/">two-factor authentication</a> on your key accounts (at least on your email and financial accounts)—it’s way more important than a good password.</li>
  <li>Freeze your credit<!-- TODO [Freeze your credit](/identity_theft/) --> at the 3 largest credit bureaus.</li>
  <li>Pay for and use <a href="/backups/">automatic backup software</a>.</li>
  <li>Turn on automatic updates on your devices.<!-- TODO justify --></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="advice-to-avoid">Advice to avoid</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Don’t</strong> worry about <a href="/passwords/">password strength</a> that much.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t</strong> pay money for <a href="/antivirus/">antivirus software</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t</strong> use or pay money for a <a href="/vpn/">VPN</a>.</li>
</ol>

<!-- TODO, is this justified?: 
It's also clear that most of the biggest threats to your [security](/security/) lie with the companies that hold your data---your bank, your email providers, your social networks.
-->

<h2 id="what">What?!</h2>

<p>Some of this advice directly contradicts what you may have heard before.</p>

<p>Security advice is hard to give. A lot of it comes from honest guesswork (and other, less honest places, too), but very little comes from real data. Most recommendations are untested theory at best—and random guesses at worst⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#herley_sok:_2017">(Herley &amp; Oorschot, 2017; Florêncio &amp; Herley, 2010)</a></span>⁠. And, since the advice generally comes from theory or guesswork, not data, it’s hard (if not impossible⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#herley_unfalsifiability_2016">(Herley, 2016)</a></span>⁠) to know what advice is useful.</p>

<p>How could you verify that, say, keeping your computer up-to-date is protecting you?</p>

<p>So our advice creeps up—and then lingers. Without data about outcomes (how does a recommendation make things better or worse?) or assumptions (who does this recommendation help?), you can only filter all that advice by what you already know. That’s why <a href="/intro/">the main guide</a> focuses on higher-level questions, instead of the threats themselves. That high level helps you triage threats.</p>

<h2 id="advice-thats-really-a-guess-can-hurt-people">Advice that’s really a guess can hurt people</h2>

<p>Security advice without data is just a guess—and <strong>guesses can easily be wrong or miss important threats</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://onlinesafety.feministfrequency.com/en/">Speak Up &amp; Stay Safe(r)</a>, a guide written by actual victims of online abuse, includes “Remove potential doxxing information” as its 3rd-most-important step⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#friedman_speak_2015">(Friedman et al., 2015)</a></span>⁠. Doxxing is a real, physical threat—<strong>people have died</strong> because of doxxing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting">swatting</a>⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#noauthor_swatting_2022">(“Swatting,” 2022; “Doxing,” 2022)</a></span>⁠.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>“Doxxing”: posting private information, like real name and address, about a target, generally as a form of harassment.</p>
</aside>

<p><strong>I have never seen this advice anywhere else</strong>. If a harassment victim didn’t know about the Speak Up guide specifically, they might never think to protect against this tangible threat. <strong>And they’d never know they were missing that advice</strong>—because the easy-to-find guides don’t acknowledge that they’re just guesses.</p>

<h2 id="security-advice-may-be-bad-but-its-not-a-lie">Security advice may be bad, but it’s not a lie</h2>

<p>But that doesn’t mean security advice is useless.</p>

<p>Even without complete data, you can probably make pretty good guesses about your biggest security threats. After all, you probably don’t need data to wear a seat belt. Similarly, sometimes the experts are right, too (but a seat belt salesperson should probably offer some data). Guesses—from novices <em>or</em> experts—will definitely miss things, and guesses will definitely get things wrong.</p>

<p>But when you hear some new advice, thinking about <em>what would make it scientific</em> can help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What <strong>outcomes</strong> might it have? How common are those outcomes?</li>
  <li>What does it <strong>assume</strong> about you and your threats?</li>
  <li>What’s it <strong>missing</strong>, or why does it claim to be <strong>complete</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Even the most crazy guess can have truth in it, somewhere. From my atypical advice to a top 10 list on Buzzfeed.</p>

<p>You can find value in most advice, anywhere. But you’ll have to determine its value on your own. Hope this helps.</p>
