	<p>We love our passwords.</p>

<p>Good passwords, password management, password sharing, security questions, breached passwords, common passwords, passphrases, on and on: we want to be good at passwords.</p>

<p>Passwords don’t really matter.</p>

<p>If you want to make your logins more secure, spend your time turning on <strong>two-factor authentication</strong> (also 2FA, TFA, or multi-factor authentication, MFA) instead.</p>

<p>You should still spend a <em>little</em> effort choosing <a href="/better_passwords/">good passwords</a>, but TFA matters much more.</p>

<h2 id="a-good-password-stops-little">A good password stops little</h2>

<p>Passwords are supposed to be hard to guess. That’s what makes them useful: an attacker needs to waste time guessing your password.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>That’s what password complexity requirements try to do: make passwords harder to guess. Too bad some end up making them easier to guess⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#grassi2017nist">(Grassi et al., 2017, Appendix A.3 Complexity)</a></span>⁠.</p>
</aside>

<p>However, in practice hackers don’t need to guess anything at all.</p>

<p>As one example, the Internet is teeming with breached usernames &amp; passwords, stolen from companies’ databases worldwide⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#troy_hunt_have_nodate">(Troy Hunt, n.d.)</a></span>⁠. Most attacks (over 20 million <em>daily</em> on Microsoft accounts alone, according to a director on the Microsoft Identity team⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#weinert_your_2019">(Weinert, 2019)</a></span>⁠) are just hackers trying these username &amp; password pairs on other sites, hoping that you reused your password.</p>

<p>And they’d be right⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#national_cyber_security_alliance_2010_2010">(National Cyber Security Alliance et al., 2010, p. 2; Stobert &amp; Biddle, 2014, p. 244; Weinert, 2019)</a></span>⁠<!-- Previous article: 62% by LastPass by LogMeIn; 2010 NCSA / Norton by Symantec Online Safety Study says 37% +/- 5% unsure; . The Tangled Web of Password Reuse via The Password Life Cycle: User Behaviour in Managing Passwords says 43% of passwords in a dataset were reused -->.</p>

<p>In these attacks, it doesn’t matter how strong your password was: whether you used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Password1!</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8zUM94oureVvjsBrsUCJYHxNWcG6</code>, the hacker already knows your old password and is trying it in new places.</p>

<h2 id="strong-passwords-dont-stop-most-common-attacks">Strong passwords don’t stop most common attacks</h2>

<p>This pattern—that password strength doesn’t really matter—appears across all other common attacks.</p>

<p>For example, hackers can just ask you for your password—phishing is pervasive and easy to perform—and your password strength doesn’t matter if you just give it to them.</p>

<p>Similarly, when hackers <em>do</em> “guess,” they almost always try the most common passwords—which can be pretty effective. But companies understand these attacks and can stop them easily: most big online companies prevent password guesses after a few failed attempts.</p>

<p>Hackers attempting this—at least against large companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Apple, and even your local bank—can only test a few dozen passwords per account per day at most. If your password is reasonably good and isn’t in the top most common passwords, you’re essentially immune.</p>

<p>This doesn’t cover all attacks on passwords, but looking at more “overall” data paints the same picture⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#florencio_administrators_2014">(Florencio et al., 2014; Weinert, 2019)</a></span>⁠. Most attacks just don’t care about password strength so long as it’s “good enough.”</p>

<h2 id="but-what-if-they-want-to-guess-me">But what if they want to guess me?</h2>

<p><em>Even</em> if hackers have stolen the database (and it was encrypted right in the first place; otherwise they basically have your password anyway and your password strength didn’t matter), it is infeasible to crack passwords at scale if your password is good enough⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#weinert_your_2019">(Weinert, 2019)</a></span>⁠.</p>

<p>That being said, if a hacker wants to target <em>you</em> specifically, they can crack almost any password given enough time and motivation.</p>

<p>That is the <em>one</em> situation where you really want a <em>good</em> password, not just a “good enough” password. And if you are being targeted like that, <a href="/help/">you should probably contact the police</a>.</p>

<h2 id="stop-everything-else">Stop everything else</h2>

<p>Instead of worrying about how many special characters to put in your password, spend time setting up two-factor authentication on your accounts, especially your most important ones.</p>

<p>“Important” accounts can be different for everyone (if you’re an influencer, your Instagram is probably extremely important), but I like to start with this list:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Email</strong>: most other accounts eventually tie back to this; keep it safe.</li>
  <li><strong>Banks &amp; finance accounts</strong>: protect your money.</li>
  <li><strong>“Cloud” accounts</strong> (iCloud, Microsoft, Google): protect your stuff.</li>
  <li><strong>Social networks</strong>: protect your online identity.</li>
</ol>

<p>I find it calming to turn on two-factor authentication for as many accounts as I can, but these are the most important (how much harm can a hacker do with your Netflix account?).</p>

<p>There are downsides and nuances to two-factor authentication (some folks argue that you should <em>never</em> use SMS-based two-factor⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#neil_c_hughes_why_2021">(Neil C. Hughes, 2021)</a></span>⁠), but those are asides that change with the times.</p>

<p>No matter what method you use, two-factor authentication will protect you from most attacks⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#weinert_all_2019">(Weinert, 2019; Weinert, 2019)</a></span>⁠.</p>

<p>You should still put a little effort into choosing <a href="/better_passwords/">reasonably good</a> passwords, but two-factor authentication does a <em>ton</em> to keep you safe.</p>

<p>At the end of the day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on our studies, your account is more than 99.9% less likely to be compromised if you use MFA.⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#weinert_your_2019">(Weinert, 2019)</a></span>⁠</p>
</blockquote>
