	<p>If you’ve even <em>heard</em> about computers, you’ve heard about viruses. And if you’ve heard about viruses, you’ve heard about anti-virus software.</p>

<p>You might pay for some, you might use a free one, or you may not know if you have any at all.</p>

<p>Honestly, in 2023, <strong>you almost certainly don’t need to pay for anti-virus software</strong>, nor do you even need to use a free 3rd-party one. There’s not much harm in doing that, but you don’t need to.</p>

<p>Your computer has built-in security software, and that’s enough. Here’s why.</p>

<h2 id="the-clinical-studies-are-optimistic">The clinical studies are optimistic</h2>

<p>The best data we have about viruses comes from a few clinical studies done in 2015 and 2016 by a Montreal researcher and Microsoft. They’re a bit old, but these studies, done on real-world users behaving normally (one study uses telemetry from over 100 million Windows devices), demonstrate 2 important things:</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft.</p>
</aside>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>3rd-party antivirus programs are more than 95% effective</strong> (even “99.45%” effective) at removing malware⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#levesque_are_2016">(Lévesque et al., 2016, pp. 12-15; Maimon, 2019; Levesque et al., 2015)</a></span>⁠<!-- levesque_measuring_2015 1.33% vs 21.43% = 6.2% => 94%; note that levesque_are_2016 writes >99% effective at malware, 56% at potentially unwanted softweare -->.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>So is Microsoft’s own anti-virus software</strong>, Microsoft Defender, built free into every Windows computer. That’s not <em>explicitly</em> studied in this research, but it’s notable that Defender detected things other programs missed; and that jives with synthetic testing like AV-Test, which consistently rates <em>all</em> anti-virus software highly, including Microsoft’s⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#noauthor_test_nodate">(<i>Test Antivirus Software for Windows 10 - December 2022</i>, n.d.; Anderson, 2018)</a></span>⁠.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Though earlier work by the same author reports ~80% effectiveness for one program⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#maimon_existing_2019">(Maimon, 2019; Lalonde Levesque et al., 2013)</a></span>⁠, and one paper notes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[…] 3rd party AVE [Anti-Virus Effectiveness] should be 100%. [Microsoft] shouldn’t need to clean up infections when the AV is doing its job⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#levesque_are_2016">(Lévesque et al., 2016, p. 23)</a></span>⁠
<!-- To be fair, same paper says, charitably: "MSRT families considered may not represent 3rd party AV priorities"; also note that this is in response to the lower 91% number including unwanted software --></p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>

<h2 id="yeah-its-happening">Yeah, it’s happening</h2>

<p>These studies also align with other research, new and old, about malware prevalance. And all the research seems to agree:</p>

<p><strong>The only really <em>bad</em> choice is skipping anti-virus software altogether.</strong></p>

<p>These same clinical trials found that <strong>15% of computers<!-- 14.85% -->—about 1 in 7—encountered malware in 4 months</strong>⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#levesque_are_2016">(Lévesque et al., 2016)</a></span>⁠. Without anti-virus software to block the malware, all of those computers would have been infected.</p>

<p>All other sources find comparable rates, describing a steady decline over time. A 2013 study from the same author reports an encounter rate of nearly 40% in 3 months⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#lalonde_levesque_clinical_2013">(Lalonde Levesque et al., 2013, p. 25)</a></span>⁠, and a Kaspersky report from 2014 agrees at 38.4% annually⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#garnaeva_kaspersky_2014">(Garnaeva et al., 2014, p. 26)</a></span>⁠. Further reports from Kaspersky, which are still published today, describe a loose decline ⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#noauthor_kaspersky_2017">(<i>Kaspersky Security Bulletin: Overall Statistics for 2017</i>, 2017, p. 4)</a></span>⁠—to 15.4% in 2021 and 2022⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#noauthor_kaspersky_2021">(<i>Kaspersky Security Bulletin 2021 Statistics</i>, 2021, p. 3; <i>Kaspersky Security Bulletin 2022 Statistics</i>, 2022, p. 16)</a></span>⁠. Similarly, Microsoft reported 18% in 2015 and similar numbers in 2017⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#anthe_microsoft_2015">(Anthe et al., 2015, p. 80; Avena et al., 2017, p. 48)</a></span>⁠<!-- 10.3, 9.1%, 7.8% Jan Feb Mar 2017 -->, but only 5.1% monthly in 2018⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#agrawal_microsoft_2019">(Agrawal et al., 2019, p. 25)</a></span>⁠<!-- Norton 2018 Cyber Security Insights Report has a self-reported encounter rate of ~26%, and ibid Kaspersky found ~30% infection rate + encounter rate when combining unprotected devices & covered devices by some metric, so I'd estimate that we'd hit some sort of steady-state infection rate of ~30% if we simply relied on people cleaning up devices when they noticed malware. -->. It’s reasonable to estimate that <strong>between 15-30% of computers—1-in-7 to 1-in-3—encounter malware annually</strong>.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Microsoft stopped reporting annual encounter rates in 2015 and now reports monthly stats, if anything, which makes comparison hard<!-- MSIR 24 reports 4% monthly encounter rate, but hard to expand to annual; seems aligned with previous data though -->.</p>
</aside>

<p>And all studies show these numbers can be much higher in some places, beyond even 50% in countries like Pakistan and Indonesia⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#anthe_microsoft_2015">(Anthe et al., 2015, p. 87)</a></span>⁠.</p>

<p>Malware is out there, so it’s good that anti-virus software is effective.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-dont-i-need-to-buy-something">So why don’t I need to buy something?</h2>

<p>Specifically, it’s good that <strong>built-in</strong> anti-virus software is effective. With the data we have—directly from synthetic testing and indirectly from real-world analysis—it seems fair to say that paid, free, and built-in anti-virus software will all protect you equally well.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>“99.45%” isn’t 100%, of course, but most antivirus software, including built-in, seems to be around that effective. They all offer near-equal protection.</p>
</aside>

<p>It’s good because you don’t have to pay for anything—you get good protection for free.</p>

<h2 id="hassle-is-a-risk">Hassle is a risk</h2>

<p>Built-in antivirus might also be good because it’s less hassle.</p>

<p>Data from Microsoft indicates that, for computers with 3rd-party antivirus, <strong>more than 10% of computers had expired, out-of-date, snoozed, or <em>no</em> antivirus protection</strong> in 2013 and 2014⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#batchelder_microsoft_2014">(Batchelder et al., 2014, pp. 22-25; Levesque et al., 2015, p. 104)</a></span>⁠<!-- Dates are a bit unclear but reflect 2H13-1H14 and June 2014-Sept 2014 respectively-->. It can be hard to keep 3rd-party software up-to-date, and <strong>outdated antivirus is almost as bad as none at all</strong>⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#batchelder_microsoft_2014">(Batchelder et al., 2014, pp. 25, 27)</a></span>⁠.</p>

<p>3rd-party antivirus is <strong>just another subscription to remember to pay for</strong>, and, in my subjective experience, it can be more annoying to remove old anti-virus software than to remove actual viruses.</p>

<h2 id="the-scarier-risks">The scarier risks</h2>

<p>Plus, there are the other more newsworthy risks to 3rd-party antivirus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It might have ties to foreign powers</strong> - the US government banned federal use of Kaspersky in 2017 for its (alledged) connections to the Russian government⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#noauthor_kaspersky_2023">(“Kaspersky Bans and Allegations of Russian Government Ties,” 2023)</a></span>⁠.</li>
  <li><strong>It might have exploitable bugs</strong> - every so often, researchers will find a bug in antivirus software that could be used to hack you⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#osborne_decade-old_2022">(Osborne, 2022; Tavis, 2016)</a></span>⁠.</li>
  <li><strong>It might make your computer slow</strong> - antivirus software always has some performance impact⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#spadafora_which_2023">(Spadafora, 2023)</a></span>⁠.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, honestly, <strong>I’m not sure any of these risks are super impactful</strong>. Kaspersky might be controlled by the Russian government, but in practice you’ll get a virus because you forgot to pay them and your subscription expired—not because the FSB installed one.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Plus, if we’re being particular, some 3rd-party software is probably faster than Microsoft’s built-in stuff⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#noauthor_performance_2022">(<i>Performance Test: Impact of Consumer Security Software on System Performance April 2022</i>, 2022, p. 5; Spadafora, 2023)</a></span>⁠.</p>
</aside>

<p>They’re just further reasons to avoid the hassle and stick with the built-in stuff.</p>

<h2 id="when-did-this-change">When did this change?</h2>

<p><strong>This conclusion is probably a bit jarring.</strong> You’ve probably gotten a virus before and remember dealing with it<!-- cite Norton? -->, so this new advice—that you don’t need to pay for anti-virus software—is probably odd. Why do you not need it? <strong>Did something change?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Anti-virus software came into a lawless world, where people desperately needed protection. In 2004, a new Windows XP computer would catch malware <strong>within 20 minutes</strong> of just <em>connecting</em> to the Internet⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#granneman_infected_2004">(Granneman, 2004; Ullrich et al., 2003; Ullrich et al., 2003; OgdruJahad, 2018)</a></span>⁠—an encounter rate and infection rate of 100%.</p>

<p>And for a while, Microsoft was really slow to respond. Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows 7 fixed many of the glaring security vulnerabilities XP had⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#fendley_readers_2005">(Fendley, 2005)</a></span>⁠, but even then a new Windows computer wouldn’t be well-equipped to deal with new threats. By Microsoft’s own data, it took until late 2015 for Windows’ built-in tools to start matching third-party anti-virus software⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#anderson_why_2018">(Anderson, 2018)</a></span>⁠.</p>

<p><strong>But now the world is different.</strong> As described above, Microsoft did their job—Defender is a great defense against viruses. And we now know from experience how difficult it is to keep 3rd-party software up-to-date.</p>

<p>In other words, even if paying for 3rd-party anti-virus software was useful at one point, it’s not necessary today.</p>

<h2 id="ios-android-mac-and-linux">iOS, Android, Mac, and Linux</h2>

<p>But let’s talk about <strong>Macs, Linux, smartphones, and IoT devices</strong>. Interestingly, we have <strong>very little data</strong> about them.</p>

<p><strong>All of these devices can get viruses</strong>—there’s nothing inherent to them that would prevent it. So are they safe?</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Although smartphones—iPhones especially—may indeed be “inherently” more secure than Mac or Windows because of how they limit the software users can run. Consider that the US government spent more than $1 million to hack a single iPhone, although the circumstances were different⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#barrett_fbi_2016">(Barrett, 2016)</a></span>⁠.</p>
</aside>

<p>We don’t have much publicly available, holistic data about malware infections on Macs. Nor for Linux machines, iPhones, your new Google Pixel, or your smart lightbulb. Kaspersky found that about 5% of its American Mac users encountered malicious software of any kind in 2021, but noted that most of the top 10 attacks were adware, not malware⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#noauthor_kaspersky_2021">(<i>Kaspersky Security Bulletin 2021 Statistics</i>, 2021, pp. 12-13)</a></span>⁠. A similar report found a 2% encounter rate on Android devices, dominated by “RiskTools” (programs that <em>can</em> be used maliciously), adware, and trojans⁠<span tabindex="0" class="citeblock"><a class="citation" href="/references/#shishkova_it_2021">(Shishkova, 2021)</a></span>⁠.</p>

<p>These numbers illustrate a few key points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There seems to be <strong>much less malicious software</strong> on non-Windows devices.</li>
  <li>Most of that malicious software <strong>seems to be adware</strong> or directly money-making in some way (it texts premium numbers from your number, for example); it’s not to steal bank information. (Although Android has a lot of trojans, which do not make money directly).</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t know for sure, but that might be what we discussed in <a href="/hackers/">Will I even be hacked?</a>—hackers want money. And on these new platforms, it’s <strong>probably easier to make money by showing ads than by stealing bank information</strong>. Windows, with its non-adware viruses, might be just a vestige of the past.</p>

<p>But I imagine that in a few years Android will have a security push, just like Windows did in 2015. And you might want anti-virus software while you wait.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>And so it all comes together: malware is almost entirely a Windows-specific problem, and <strong>Windows has a great built-in solution</strong>.</p>

<p>Computers across the globe <strong>still encounter malware</strong>, but Microsoft Defender does a great job protecting against it, <strong>without the hassle</strong> of a 3rd-party subscription.</p>

<p>It’s worth looking to the <strong>emerging markets</strong>, like Android (and maybe iOS), or paying extra attention if you live in a <strong>high-risk country</strong> (like Pakistan and Indonesia), but even so I would invest my money elsewhere, like using an <a href="/backups/">automated backup service</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to keep your device safe, I would <strong>recommend these steps instead</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn on <strong>automatic updates</strong>, and make sure you’re always up to date.</li>
  <li><a href="/backups/"><strong>Back up your data</strong> automatically</a>.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>If you currently <strong>have</strong> a virus, check out <a href="/help/">I’m under attack now</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Why? Well, in 2017, the huge WannaCry ransomware attack<!-- wiki wannacry --> had 2 noteworthy features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft released patches for it <em>two months</em> before the attack started.</li>
  <li>The malware encrypted your files and demanded payment to release them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both <strong>automatic updates</strong> and a <strong>good backup</strong> would have protected you <strong>completely</strong>. And they’re both <strong>cheaper than buying anti-virus software</strong>.</p>
